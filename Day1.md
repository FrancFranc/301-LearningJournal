# Day 1

Learnt a new language -- JQuery.  Totally different from Javascript.  I like the way how it can change/add things in html.  Seems it is easier than using javascript.  For the responsive part, I didnt realize that the webpages that I usually visit  are actually containing responsive element.  I feel like I have learnt a lot.

I paired programme with Alexis, we tried and tried on different codes.  Somehow we were just guessing, but things worked!
