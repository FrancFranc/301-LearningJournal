# Day 8

These two days I have learnt Node JD and SQL.  I kinda had an idea about the front-end and back-end workflow.   But I really dont know how to code.  Even I had read the materials, I still not confident about it.

I found I am very weak on coding.  In fact I totally dont understand about the starter code.

Keep adding things to the blog app.  however I have no idea what's going on.  My classmates know more than I do on the assignment.  Giving up a bit though.
