# Day 11

Finally come to the third week.  HOnestly, I do not know to continue 401.  At this moment, I am very behind.  Becoz I dont understand.  And I kinda had lost a bit of interest to keep up.   I tried to start the CodeWar, even for the 1st task, I guess it is the simpliest one.  I cant even know what is the answer.  I gave up.  I dont even want to find out the answer.  I really dont like javascript.  Probably I will skip the codewar.   

For the blog app, that sucks. Have no idea of what's going on each and everyday.  why some codes changed?  what they have changed?  If I tell you after finsihing the assignment I know I was doing, it is a lie.   I guess since from the very last Monday, I already behind on the blog app.  Until now, I dont know how to keep it up and finsih the entrance test for 401. Huh.
