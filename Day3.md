# Day 3

Start doing my portfolio page.   I already have the idea of what I want.   I visited a couple webpages and gather the things and features that I like, and gonna combine them altogether with some alternations.  

The pair-programming lab of yesterday's is really difficult.  In fact, until now, I still didnt understand what's going on.  Why there's an object inside an object.   I dont understand the reason behind.   I feel like I didnt learn a lot each day.  Because I dont understand.
