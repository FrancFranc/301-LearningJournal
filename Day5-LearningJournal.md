#Day 5

This week I don't feel like I have learnt a lot.  Because most of the time, I don't understand.  I kinda have an idea about the tab things.  My question for myself is switched from "I dont know what I dont understand" to "I dont know what I understand.  Therefore I really do not have much to say in this learning journal.  

I appreciate Sam gave a long lecture on Friday.   This weekend I am trying to do more on my portfolio and catch up on some of the readings.
