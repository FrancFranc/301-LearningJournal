# Day 7

I learnt wht is JSON, database, AJAX, etc.  When I read the textbook, I kinda understand what's going on, but when things are combined together, my brain got messed up.  Why and how JSON is dealing with database.


These couple days, I was working on my portfolio.  I deleted my old codes, because those are helped by Megan.   Even though the things worked, but I dont understand. Since I dont understand, when I wanna make some changes, I do not know where and what to change.  Therefore, I decided to start from beginning.  I mean the template ppart. Eventually it worked.  But then still have some bugs.  But at least I know the concept and what's going on.  So, I deleted again, and used the handlebars.  Then I also knwo what's going on with handlebars.   I know it took me a long time to re-do, but at least I know what's going on and how to do it.


Right now, I just need  more CSS, and my page will be done.

Tonight, I will catch up on the readings of the last two days.   In fact this learning journal is for Monday's.   Well, I will write one more tonight.
