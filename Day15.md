# Day 15

Finally come to the last learning journal of 301.  Time flies.  Comparing to 201, this course is less intense but more difficult.  In fact, up until now, I still do not really understand the back-end side.   But I feel better.  One thing I found is, some of the materials that Sam provided is difficult to understand, such as the REST from wikipedia.  I know they are in English, I know the words, but I don't understand.  And then I searched REST on youtube, it is way simplier to understand.  That's the problem.  If things can be explained in an easier way, why not?   It might be my language problem.  I am not sure.  But one thing I know is, I am not the only student in this class who do not understand the materials even after they took the entrance test.  

This week is the project week.  I am excited.  One thing is I like my groupmates.  Another thing is finally I can learn the back-end side again.
