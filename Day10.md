#Day 10


One thing I dont like about this course is, github.   Too many repo.  It is really annoying.  When I want to see the lab instructions, I have go to one repo, but I need starter code from somewhere else.  And then hand in assignments in canvas.   Very annoying.  This is unnecessary.  And one more thing.  In the very beginning of this class, instructions are provided to making new directories in local.  That's fxxking annoying.   SO many repo need to be cloned. it really messed up my directories.  When I go to the terminal and cd the directory, I always do not know what name it is.  Because so many "301-" in front. FXXK.
